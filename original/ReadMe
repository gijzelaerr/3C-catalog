Description:
    The 3C Catalog is the result of observations with the Cambridge
    four-element interferometer at a frequency of 159MHz, and contains
    471 sources between declinations -22 and +71degrees, with a flux
    density larger than 8Jy.

    The Revised version of the 3C (3CR) is based on new observations at a
    frequency of 178MHz, and represents a survey of all sources North of
    -05degrees with a flux density brighter than 9Jy, except in the areas
    near the ridge of galactic emission. The original numbering system has
    been preserved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note (1): the numbers with parenthesis are doubtful
    either because the data are incomplete (due mainly to interferences)
    or because of exceptionally large spreads in the individual position
    or amplitude estimates.

Note (2): analysis flag:
    'A' indicates that the records could be analysed without recourse to a
        vector analysis of confused traces.
    'B' shows that some analysis of confused traces was made.

Note (3): Where there is some ambiguity in deciding on the correct
    interference lobe the alternative positions are marked thus:
     RA:  -> Possibly lobe-shifted earlier
          <- Possibly lobe-shifted later
         <-> Possibly lobe-shifted earlier or later
     DE:  ^  Possibly lobe-shifted North
          v  Possibly lobe-shifted South
         v^  Possibly lobe-shifted North or South

Note (4):
    The symbols ->, <-, ^, v are used to indicate that a 2C source
    (Shakeshaft et al., 1955MmRAS..67..106S) has had to be lobe-shifted
    earlier (->), later (<-), North (^) or South (v).
    Sources denoted DWD will be discussed by Dewhirst in a separate paper.

Note (1): The numbering of the sources follows as far as possible that of
    the 3C catalogue. Some sources are omitted on account of errors in the
    original list, others because areas south of -5{deg} have not been
    covered in the new survey; a number of additional sources in areas not
    covered in the original survey have been added. The 3CR numbers keep
    the ordering by increasing R.A.

Note (2): All flux densities observed with the 469{lambda} interferometer
    are marked by an asterisk; for all other sources the total power
    measurement was used, subtracting the systematic correction of 1.5Jy,
    according to the discussion by Bennett (1962MNRAS.125...75B)
